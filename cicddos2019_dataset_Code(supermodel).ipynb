    "### Boruta Feature Selection\n",
    "BorutaPy is a wrapper algorithm around the Random Forest (or any tree-based model) that attempts to find all relevant features for a given task. It performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shadow Features: Adds copies of all features (called shadow features) and shuffles their values to create random noise.\n",
    "2. Model Training: Trains a Random Forest classifier on the extended dataset.\n",
    "3. Importance Comparison: Compares the importance of actual features to their shadow counterparts.\n",
    "4. Feature Selection: Marks a feature as important if its importance is higher than the best-performing shadow feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LightGBM Classifier\n",
    "LightGBM is a highly efficient Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) implementation. It's known for its speed and performance, particularly on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LightGBM?\n",
    "1. Efficiency: Faster training and prediction speed.\n",
    "2. Scalability: Handles large datasets with high dimensionality well.\n",
    "3. Accuracy: Often achieves high predictive performance.\n",
    "4. Flexibility: Supports a wide range of hyperparameters for fine-tuning.\n",
    "### Hyperparameters Used for LightGBM Parameters\n",
    "1. boosting_type='gbdt': Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, a robust boosting method.\n",
    "2. objective='binary': Objective function for binary classification.\n",
    "3. metric='binary_logloss': Evaluation metric for binary classification.\n",
    "4. class_weight='balanced': Balances the class weights to handle imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "5. learning_rate=0.5: Step size shrinkage used to prevent overfitting. A higher learning rate can speed up convergence but may require more regularization.\n",
    "6. max_depth=10: Maximum depth of a tree. Controls overfitting.\n",
    "7. num_leaves=50: Maximum number of leaves in one tree. Larger values can capture more complex patterns.\n",
    "8. min_child_samples=20: Minimum number of data points in a leaf. Helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "9. subsample=0.8: Fraction of samples used for training each tree. Provides regularization.\n",
    "10. colsample_bytree=0.8: Fraction of features used for training each tree. Helps in regularization and preventing overfitting.\n",
    "11. reg_alpha=0.5: L1 regularization term on weights. Helps in feature selection by shrinking weights of less important features.\n",
    "12. reg_lambda=0.5: L2 regularization term on weights. Adds penalty for large coefficients to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "13. n_estimators=100: Number of trees in the ensemble. More trees can improve performance but also increase training time.\n",
    "### Hyperparameters Used for BorutaPy Parameters\n",
    "1. n_estimators='auto': Automatically decides the number of trees.\n",
    "2. max_iter=50: Maximum number of iterations to run the Boruta algorithm.\n",
    "3. perc=100: Percentage of features to consider during the selection. Here, 100% of features are considered.\n",
    "4. alpha=0.5: Significance level to use for selecting features. Higher values make the algorithm more conservative.\n",
    "5. two_step=True: Uses a two-step method to reduce computing time by first selecting all relevant features and then performing a final confirmation step.\n",
    "6. random_state=42: Ensures reproducibility of results.\n",
    "7. verbose=2: Verbosity level to control the amount of logging information.\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "1. Comprehensive Feature Selection: Boruta ensures that all relevant features are selected, reducing the risk of omitting important variables.\n",
    "2. Noise Reduction: By comparing to shadow features, Boruta effectively removes noise and irrelevant features.\n",
    "3. Model Performance: LightGBM's efficiency and scalability ensure fast training and high predictive performance.\n",
    "4. Hyperparameter Tuning: The extensive hyperparameter options in LightGBM allow for fine-tuning to improve model performance and feature selection accuracy.\n",
    "6. Balanced Handling: class_weight='balanced' ensures that imbalanced datasets are handled properly, which is crucial in many real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining Boruta with LightGBM, you leverage the strengths of both: Boruta’s thorough feature selection process and LightGBM’s high performance and efficiency. This combination ensures that the final model is both accurate and interpretable, with a reduced feature set that still captures the essential information from the dataset."

   "source": [
    "## Model Overview\n",
    "#### The model you're working with is a hybrid approach that combines a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with an attention mechanism and a stacking classifier for DDoS attack detection in Software Defined Networks (SDNs). This approach leverages deep learning for feature extraction and classical machine learning for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "### 1. Attention Layer\n",
    "#### An attention layer helps the model focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequence by assigning different weights to different parts. This mechanism is inspired by the human cognitive process of selectively focusing on certain pieces of information while ignoring others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> Weights (W, b, u): These are learnable parameters that help in calculating the attention scores.\n",
    "#### --> Score Calculation: A tanh activation is applied to a weighted sum of the inputs and biases.\n",
    "#### --> Attention Weights: Softmax is applied to the scores to obtain the attention weights.\n",
    "#### --> Context Vector: The context vector is computed as a weighted sum of the inputs based on the attention weights.\n",
    "### 2. Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)\n",
    "#### A TCN is used for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. It is particularly useful for time-series data or any data where the order of the information matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Conv1D Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> 64, 128, 256, 512 filters: The number of filters in each convolutional layer. Higher filters capture more complex patterns.\n",
    "#### --> Kernel Size (3): The size of the convolutional window. A kernel size of 3 is typical for extracting features from sequences.\n",
    "#### --> Activation ('relu'): Rectified Linear Unit activation function introduces non-linearity and helps in learning complex patterns.\n",
    "#### --> Padding ('same'): Ensures that the output has the same length as the input by padding the input with zeros.\n",
    "#### --> MaxPooling1D Layers: These layers downsample the input by taking the maximum value over a window, reducing the dimensionality and computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> Dropout Layer (0.5): A dropout rate of 0.5 means 50% of the neurons are randomly dropped during training, which helps in preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### II. Dense Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> 128 units: Fully connected layer with 128 neurons.\n",
    "#### --> Activation ('relu'): Again, the ReLU activation function is used for introducing non-linearity.\n",
    "#### III. Output Layer:\n",
    "### --> Softmax Activation: Used for class classification, it converts the logits into probabilities.\n",
    "### 3. Training the Enhanced TCN Model\n",
    "#### --> EarlyStopping: This callback stops training when the validation loss stops improving, preventing overfitting and reducing training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### -->Training Process: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss, suitable for multi-class classification as weell as binart-classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Stacking Classifier\n",
    "#### Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple classification models via a meta-classifier to improve the overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> Logistic Regression (Base and Meta Estimator): A simple and interpretable model that works well as a meta-classifier due to its ability to weigh the predictions of the base classifiers.\n",
    "#### --> Hyperparameters (C): Inverse of regularization strength. Lower values specify stronger regularization, helping in preventing overfitting.\n",
    "#### --> GridSearchCV: Used for hyperparameter tuning to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the stacking classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Parameter Grid:\n",
    "#### --> lr__C: Regularization parameter for the logistic regression base estimator.\n",
    "#### --> final_estimator__C: Regularization parameter for the logistic regression meta-estimator.\n",
    "#### --> Cross-Validation (cv=2): Splits the data into 2 parts for training and validation during hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "#### --> Scoring (accuracy): Uses accuracy as the metric to evaluate the models.\n",
    "#### --> Parallel Processing (n_jobs=-1): Utilizes all available CPUs for faster computation.\n",
    "### 5. Model Evaluation\n",
    "#### --> Predictions: The TCN model is used to extract features from the input data, which are then used by the stacking classifier for final predictions.\n",
    "#### --> Accuracy Score: Evaluates the performance of the hybrid model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Benefits of the Techniques and Parameters Used)\n",
    "#### --> Attention Mechanism: Helps in focusing on the most relevant parts of the sequence, improving the model's ability to learn important patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> TCN: Captures temporal dependencies in the data, which is crucial for time-series or sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> Dropout: Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> Stacking Classifier: Combines the strengths of multiple classifiers, leading to improved predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> GridSearchCV: Systematically searches for the best hyperparameters, enhancing model performance through fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> EarlyStopping: Prevents overfitting and reduces training time by stopping early when the model's performance stops improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By combining these advanced techniques, the model aims to achieve high accuracy and robustness in detecting DDoS attacks in SDNs, leveraging both deep learning and ensemble learning principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downsampling Example:\n",
    "#### Consider an example input sequence and a MaxPooling1D layer with a pool size of 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Sequence: [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4, 8]\n",
    "#### Pool Size: 2\n",
    "#### The pooling operation would proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ####First Window: [2, 3] → Maximum is 3\n",
    "#### Second Window: [1, 5] → Maximum is 5\n",
    "#### Third Window: [6, 2] → Maximum is 6\n",
    "#### Fourth Window: [4, 8] → Maximum is 8\n",
    "#### Output Sequence after MaxPooling: [3, 5, 6, 8]"
